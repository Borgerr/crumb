# Contributing to crumb

Thank you for your interest in contributing to crumb.
As of the latest version of `CONTRIBUTE.md`, this compiler is most definitely
a personal project. However, if you notice something that could be better improved for style points,
then by all means, please submit a PR.
People at my university are especially encouraged to do this.
